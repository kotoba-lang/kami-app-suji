  "kami-app-suji — run the portable half of the suite on ClojureScript.

  WHY IT EXISTS, and why its absence was the same defect this repo's README
  already describes happening next door. `suji` was named `.cljc` while calling
  `Math/toRadians` and `Double/POSITIVE_INFINITY`; its JVM suite was green and the
  library did not load in a browser, because a JVM-only suite returns the same
  green for `.cljc` that is portable and `.cljc` that only claims to be.

  This app is a BROWSER app whose views, scene and coverage census are all `.cljc`,
  and until 2026-09-08 every one of its tests ran on the JVM only. The one host
  that matters for a page nobody could reach was the one host nothing was checked
  on. Run it with:

      nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -Spath):test\" scripts/nbb_test.cljs

  SCOPE — `repo-test` is deliberately absent. It shells out to `git ls-files` and
  slurps tracked files off disk; it checks properties of the checkout, not of
  anything portable, and is JVM-only by nature rather than by accident. Everything
  that renders a view, builds a scene or counts coverage runs on both hosts.

  ⚠ A NAMESPACE NEEDS AN ENTRY IN BOTH PLACES BELOW — the `:require` and the
  `namespaces` vector. Requiring it without listing it loads the file and runs
  none of its tests, which is the same silent pass this runner exists to prevent."

(def ^:private min-tests
  "An evidence floor. A runner that loads no namespace, or that stops finding vars
  because a require was dropped, must not be able to print a pass — and it exits
  2, which is neither the 0 of a pass nor the 1 of a failure, so `could not answer`
  is distinguishable from both.

  Forty-five was one below the count on the day it landed; sixty-five is one below
  the count after the pelvic-tilt work (66 on 2026-09-09). It has to move when the
  suite grows, which makes removing a namespace a deliberate edit here rather than
  a number quietly going down."
