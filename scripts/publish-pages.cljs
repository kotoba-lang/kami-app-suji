  "Publish `public/` to GitHub Pages **without GitHub Actions**.

  ── why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` built this site until 2026-08-04. The publish path
  is this script now, because CI/CD in this workspace is the murakumo fleet and not
  GitHub (ADR-2607300900), and because a publish path that stops SILENTLY is worse
  than none: the sibling app `kami-app-daw` kept serving the pre-DADS liquid-glass
  page for weeks after it moved onto jp-go-dds, and nothing failed, because nothing
  ran.

  ⚠ THIS DOCSTRING SAID `Actions are now disabled repo-wide`, AND THAT IS FALSE
  FOR THIS REPO. Measured 2026-09-09:
  `gh api repos/kotoba-lang/kami-app-suji/actions/permissions` returns
  `{"enabled":true,"allowed_actions":"all"}`. The sweep that disabled Actions
  elsewhere did not reach here, and the workspace rule is explicit that the state
  is not knowable from the tree — a `.github/` directory says nothing either way,
  and a request that could not be read must not be recorded as `disabled`. So ASK
  before repeating it; do not infer it from this file, and do not add a workflow to
  make it moot.

  The workflow file itself is still in the tree. Deleting it needs the `workflow`
  OAuth scope, which this workspace's token does not have.

  ── what it does ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Commits the built `public/` as the *root* tree of `refs/heads/gh-pages` and
  pushes it; Pages serves that branch directly, so no runner is involved. The
  commit is assembled with plumbing against a throwaway index, so the branch you
  are on is untouched — the only file written is `public/.nojekyll`.

  ── the guard that matters ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Deploys have no fast-forward check: last writer wins. Publishing from a
  checkout that does not contain `origin/main` silently reverts whatever landed
  in between — this happened to kotobase.net on 2026-07-25, where a signup-funnel
  fix was undone 11 minutes later by an older checkout, and nobody noticed. So
  this refuses unless `origin/main` is an ancestor of HEAD.
