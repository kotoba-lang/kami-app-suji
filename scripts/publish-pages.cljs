  "Publish `public/` to GitHub Pages **without GitHub Actions**.

  ── why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` built this site until 2026-08-04. Actions are
  now disabled repo-wide (ADR-2607300900: CI/CD is the murakumo fleet, not
  GitHub), so the workflow cannot run — and because it cannot run, nothing ever
  failed. the sibling app `kami-app-daw` simply kept serving the last
  artifact it had built: the pre-DADS liquid-glass page, long after the app moved
  onto jp-go-dds. A publish path that stops silently is worse than none, so this
  is the publish path now.

  The workflow file itself is still in the tree, and inert. Deleting it needs the
  `workflow` OAuth scope, which this workspace's token does not have.

  ── what it does ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Commits the built `public/` as the *root* tree of `refs/heads/gh-pages` and
  pushes it; Pages serves that branch directly, so no runner is involved. The
  commit is assembled with plumbing against a throwaway index, so the branch you
  are on is untouched — the only file written is `public/.nojekyll`.

  ── the guard that matters ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Deploys have no fast-forward check: last writer wins. Publishing from a
  checkout that does not contain `origin/main` silently reverts whatever landed
  in between — this happened to kotobase.net on 2026-07-25, where a signup-funnel
  fix was undone 11 minutes later by an older checkout, and nobody noticed. So
  this refuses unless `origin/main` is an ancestor of HEAD.

  Run:  npm run publish:pages
  Dry:  npm run publish:pages -- --dry-run"
