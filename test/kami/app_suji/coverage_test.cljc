  "The coverage census, and whether it can fail.

  THE MEASUREMENT THESE TESTS DEFEND. `suji` produces a few hundred numbers per
  posture and this app renders some of them. Nothing else in this repo notices
  when the model gains a quantity and no view reads it — the new key sits in a map,
  the compiler is happy, every test stays green, and the page silently answers a
  smaller question than the model can. `kami.app-suji.coverage` counts that, and
  these tests are what stop the count being a sentence somebody typed.

  Three things are asserted, and the third is the one that matters:

    1. every quantity the model produces is classified, and the classification
       names nothing the model has stopped producing;
    2. every quantity claimed `:shown` is found on a rendered page;
    3. THE PROBE CAN SAY NO. A check that only ever passes is not a check, and
       this repo's own record has three cases of one searching flattened page text
       and finding the prose beside the thing it was looking for. So a page with a
       view removed is probed too, and the quantities that lived in that view have
       to come back absent while the ones that did not have to stay found."

  "Postures the census is taken at.

  MORE THAN ONE, because the probe is a difference. A quantity is `shown` when a
  value it takes at one posture is on the page there and NOT on the page at a
  posture where the model does not give it that value — a figure matching by
  coincidence matches at both, because the coincidence does not move when the
  posture does. One posture cannot ask that question at all.

  Each of these is here for a quantity that the others leave unprobeable:
  a bigger body moves the disc areas, which are otherwise constant; the
  out-of-plane posture is the only one with a frontal-plane moment; standing is
  the only one with a ground reaction and a centre of pressure."
