  ;; ⚠ THIS TEST SAID THE OPPOSITE UNTIL 2026-09-08, and it was right when it was
  ;; written. It was called `the-upper-cervical-flexors-carry-nothing-this-app-can-
  ;; reach` and it asserted zero force at every corner of the reachable box, on the
  ;; reasoning that a flexor takes load only when the skull's centre of mass sits
  ;; behind the condyles — a head tipped back, which these sliders cannot reach.
  ;;
  ;; That reasoning belonged to the CLOSED FORM. `recruit/share` solved one
  ;; equilibrium at a time, so the flexion side of the atlanto-occipital joint was
  ;; a separate task with its own load, and that load was gravity's alone. With
  ;; `recruit/solve` the two neck joints are one system: the extensors sized at C7
  ;; over-extend the joint above them, and the optimum answers by giving the
  ;; flexors force. Measured at head 0 / trunk 30: longus capitis 2.85 N, 2.58 %MVC.
  ;;
  ;; So the old assertion did not detect a regression — it recorded a property of a
  ;; solver that has been replaced. What is worth pinning is the STRUCTURE that
  ;; replaced it: these muscles are members of the coupled neck group, the group
  ;; converged, and their own-joint coefficient is negative because `:coeff` is now
  ;; a raw signed arm rather than one turned to face its task.
