  "How much of what `suji` computes reaches the person looking at the page.

  THE QUESTION, AND WHY IT NEEDS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A SENTENCE. This app is
  the visible half of a model that produces several hundred numbers per posture.
  Nothing in the compiler, the tests or the browser check notices when the model
  gains a quantity and the page does not: the new key simply sits in a map that no
  view reads. The failure is silent by construction, and it has already happened
  here twice in the other direction — the README recorded five 'we do not have
  this' claims that were all false, and `method-view` four.

  So the census is COMPUTED, in three parts, and only the middle one is written
  by hand:

    `produced`     every quantity the app's own solve puts in a map, derived by
                   walking the actual result. Grows on its own when `suji` does.
    `registry`     for each produced quantity, whether a view renders it. This is
                   the claim, and `coverage-test` is what stops it being prose.
    `unrequested`  quantities `suji` will produce if asked, from entry points no
                   view calls. Also derived — by calling them.

  WHAT `:shown` HAS TO SURVIVE. A claim of `:shown` is checked by rendering every
  view and looking for the quantity's own VALUES inside a value-bearing element —
  a table cell, a readout figure, a `<strong>` — never in flattened page text. The
  distinction is not pedantry: three separate checks in this repo passed on prose
  that mentioned the thing beside the place the thing had been deleted from. A
  per-row quantity must be found for most of its rows, so one coincidental match
  in sixty cannot carry a column that is not there.

  NON-DIAGNOSTIC (G1): this namespace counts keys. It holds no clinical claim."

    :shown               a view puts this value on the page
    :computed-not-shown  the solve produces it and nothing renders it

  `:token` is for a quantity whose rendering is not a number the probe can look
  for — a keyword, a boolean, a name, or a small integer count. It names the
  literal text the page must carry in a value-bearing element for the claim to
  hold, and `:from-value` means `use the model's own strings`, which is stronger
  because nobody has to keep it in step.

  A COUNT GETS ITS FIGURE'S LABEL, and that is a deliberately weaker check. There
  are four antagonists at the default posture and `4` occurs in `4.0`, `14` and
  `40` on any page with a hundred numbers on it, so the digits cannot answer. What
  can is that the figure is there at all — and the label is the text that
  disappears when it goes. The duplication is real: reword the label and this test
  fails until the registry is reworded too, which is the trade for being able to
  detect the figure's removal.

  The states are checked, not decorative: `every-produced-quantity-is-classified`
  fails when `suji` adds a key nobody has classified, and
  `every-shown-quantity-is-actually-on-the-page` fails when a `:shown` one stops
  being rendered."

  — is a constant nobody can derive. Measured 2026-09-07: at four postures a
