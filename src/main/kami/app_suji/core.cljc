  WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. `suji` moved to `recruit/solve` on 2026-09-08 — one
  optimisation over several equilibria instead of one per joint — and everything
  it says about its own answer arrived with it: which muscles were solved together,
  whether the Newton iteration converged, the equilibrium error left at each joint,
  the price that decides which muscles are switched off, and which second joints
  are still fed by nothing. A coverage census of this app measured every one of
  those as computed and not shown. The forces changed a great deal at the same
  moment — 22.1 to 39.2 %MVC at the cervical extensors — and the page had no way
  to say what had changed or whether the new numbers satisfied anything.

  THE RESIDUAL IS THE POINT OF IT. An unconverged group refuses outright, so every
  number on this page comes from a solve that claims to have satisfied its
  equilibria; `:coupled-residual-nm` is that claim in newton-metres, and printing
  it is the difference between a reader who can check and one who has to believe.
  It is reported in picoNewton-metres because it is zero to floating point — at
  1e-11 N·m every fixed-decimal rendering in newton-metres is `0.00`, and a column
