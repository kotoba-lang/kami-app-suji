  It owns no geometry and no camera maths. `kami.webgpu.geometry` tessellates the

  including the WebGPU→WebGL 2.0 fallback, which `init-canvas!` performs internally,
  so this app never inspects `navigator.gpu` itself.

  Meshes are uploaded ONCE and re-drawn per frame with a different transform each.
  Re-uploading per frame would make every slider move allocate GPU buffers for
  geometry that never changed — and stature IS a slider, so the bones have to
  track a changing length without being re-tessellated. They do, because every
  template is generated at unit length and unit shaft radius and the transform
  carries the real size; see the note in `kami.app-suji.scene`."

;; ONE UPLOAD PER DRAWN OBJECT, not one per shape.
;;
;; `mesh/render-scene!` reads its per-draw uniforms — the MVP and the colour —
;; out of the buffer handle that came back from `upload-mesh!`, writing them with
;; `write-buffer!` as it encodes each draw. Every draw in the pass is encoded
;; before any of them executes, so N draws that share one uploaded mesh all read
;; the LAST uniform written: they land on top of each other and the frame shows
;; one object. Measured 2026-09-06 — the six bones rendered as a single rod, with
;; no error and a plausible-looking picture, which is the worst way for this to
;; fail. The buffers are per-slot and re-transformed each frame; the sphere and
;; the cylinder are tessellated once each at load, and each bone shape once the
;; first time a segment asks for it.
;; THE POOLS ARE NOT FIXED, AND THEY USED TO BE. Until 2026-09-07 this file
;; declared twelve bone slots, twelve joint slots, twenty muscle slots and twelve
;; disc slots, took that many draws and dropped the rest, and wrote a
;; `console.error` saying to raise the counts. The counts were never raised.
;;
;; Measured on the default posture the day the lower limb landed: the scene
;; produced 15 bones, 20 joints and 48 muscles. Three bones, eight joints and
;; TWENTY-EIGHT muscles were not drawn — more than half the musculature — and the
;; only symptom was a line in a console nobody reads, while the picture looked
;; entirely plausible.
;;
;; A cap that is a constant is a cap that goes stale the moment the physics grows,
;; which this physics does about once an hour. Buffers are allocated on demand and
;; kept, so the pool settles at the largest scene the session has drawn.
