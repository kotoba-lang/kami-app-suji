  "Mount, state and the event loop. Everything renderable lives in
  `kami.app-suji.core` as pure functions of a state map; this namespace holds the
  one atom, the fragment listener and the canvas lifecycle.

  Recomputation is synchronous and total: a slider move rebuilds the body, the
  pose, the loads, the tensions and the scene from scratch. That is affordable
  because `suji` is pure arithmetic over six segments — there is no solver to warm
  and no state to invalidate — and it means the picture and the numbers are always
  the same instant's answer."

  This runs after EVERY render rather than once at startup. React 18's

  yet when `init!` returns; a single `requestAnimationFrame` after mount raced it
  and lost, and because the attempt was never repeated the viewport stayed
  uninitialised for the life of the page — with no error anywhere, since
  `when-let` on a missing element simply does nothing. (Measured 2026-09-06: the
  canvas kept its default 300x150 backing store and the page reported no
  backend.) It also handles the canvas going away and coming back when the reader
  leaves the simulator view and returns.

  `binding-canvas?` guards against starting a second init while the first
  promise is still in flight — after-render fires again before it resolves."
