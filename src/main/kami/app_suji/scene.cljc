  "kami-app-suji — posture + solved loads → a render scene, as pure data.

  This namespace is `.cljc` and holds NO rendering: no canvas, no GPU object, no
  `js/`. It turns what `suji` computed into the draw list `kami.webgpu.mesh` /
  `kami.webgl` consume, so the picture is testable without a browser and the thing
  under test is the mapping rather than the driver.

  AUTHORITY. The chain's placement comes from `suji.methods.pose`; the tessellation
  comes from `kami.webgpu.geometry`. This app tessellates nothing and places nothing
  — if a bone is in the wrong place here it is in the wrong place in the physics too,
  which is the point of them sharing one source.

  COLOUR IS A CLAIM. Each bone is tinted by the load carried at the joint it hangs
  from, expressed as the highest %MVC among the muscles that cross that joint —
  a mechanical quantity, force divided by maximum voluntary force.

  ⚠ IT IS NOT THE TABLE の QUANTITY, and this docstring claimed it was until
  2026-09-07: it said the bands here were the same ones `strain/stiffness-band`
  uses for text, so the picture and the table could not say different things. They
  say different things at almost every load. Measured at a 120-minute session:

      9 %MVC   picture moderate   table very-high
     15 %MVC   picture high       table very-high
      5 %MVC   picture moderate   table low

  The picture bands an INSTANTANEOUS load and the table bands an ACCUMULATED DOSE,
  which depends on how long the posture is held; at 120 minutes a muscle at
  9 %MVC has a high dose and a low instantaneous load, and both statements are
  true. The defect was never the colours — it was sharing the four words
  low/moderate/high/very-high between two quantities and then asserting they could
  not disagree. The legend now carries which quantity it bands.

  NON-DIAGNOSTIC (G1): a colour is not a finding, and there is no colour in this
  file that means anything clinical."

;; --- geometry placement ------------------------------------------------------
;; Every generator in `kami.webgpu.geometry` is built along +Y and centred, so a
;; bone is that shape scaled to its length, rotated about Z onto its direction and
;; translated to its midpoint. The pose already carries the rotation as `:euler-z`,
;; so this is placement, not trigonometry.
;;
;; A BONE IS TESSELLATED AT ITS OWN SIZE, NOT AT UNIT SIZE AND SCALED. That is a
;; change from how the cylinder was drawn, and it was forced by measurement.
;;
;; The cylinder could be built once at radius 1 / height 1 and scaled by
;; [r, L, r], because a cylinder's side normals are purely radial and its cap
;; normals are purely axial: an anisotropic scale leaves both correct by accident.
;; An anatomical bone has neither property. Two things break:
;;
;;   1. Its normals. Under a scale of [0.032, 0.31, 0.032] a normal has to be
;;      transformed by the inverse transpose, and `mesh/model-matrix` does not do
;;      that. The condylar flares — the whole point of this shape — are exactly
;;      the surfaces whose normals have a large axial component, so they are
;;      exactly the ones a 10:1 anisotropic scale would light wrongly.
;;   2. Its topology. `loft` splits a ring into a hard edge when the two bands
;;      meet more sharply than 60°, and how sharp that is depends on the ASPECT
;;      RATIO. Measured 2026-09-07 with the humerus parameters: at unit aspect the
;;      mesh has 378 vertices, at the real 0.31 m × 0.032 m it has 357 — one ring
;;      creases at unit aspect that does not crease on a real humerus. So the unit
;;      template is not the sized mesh, and drawing it scaled would put hard
;;      shading edges where the real bone is smooth.
;;
;; Tessellating per frame is not affordable either — stature is a live slider and
;; each rebuild is a GPU upload. So the length is BUCKETED geometrically: at most
;; one mesh per 5% of length, which bounds a full sweep of the stature slider to
;; about nine meshes per bone instead of one per frame, and leaves a residual
;; scale of under 2.5% on one axis. `bone-mesh-length-m` below is that bucket, and
